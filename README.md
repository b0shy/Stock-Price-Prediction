# Stock Price Prediction Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
By: Bashar Shabani

This notebook implements a stock price prediction model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with two layers

## Project Overview
Stock prices are influenced by a variety of factors, and predicting future prices requires models capable of capturing sequential patterns over time. In this project, we will:
- Load and preprocess historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- Experiment with different time window sizes (5 and 10 days) for sequence-based prediction.
- Construct and train a two-layer RNN model with dropout layers to reduce overfitting.
- Evaluate the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- Visualize the predicted prices against actual prices and assess the model's convergence.
- Generate a next-day stock price prediction using the trained model.

Each cell in this notebook corresponds to a specific stage in the modeling process, from data loading and preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.
